# Frontend Routes and Feature Map

This document maps the primary UI routes in `aragora/live` to their purpose and related documentation.
It is the canonical map for the user-facing surface area.

## Canonical UI Domains

- `https://aragora.ai` serves the live dashboard.
- `https://www.aragora.ai` serves the marketing landing page.

Local development uses `http://localhost:3000` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL` from `.env.local`.
