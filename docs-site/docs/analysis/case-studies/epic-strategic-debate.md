# Strategic Positioning Debate: Internal Example

> **Note:** This documents an internal use of Aragora to stress-test its own positioning and messaging. This is an example of how multi-agent debate can be used for strategic decision-making.

## Context

Aragora's multi-agent debate capability was used internally to converge on a defensible product positioning. The goal was to identify the clearest buyer/problem fit through adversarial critique.

## Setup

- **Prompt:** "What should Aragora be, who is it for, and why now?"
- **Agents:** Multiple agents across different model providers
- **Phases:** Pitch → Roast → Defense → Synthesis → Verdict

## Resulting Positioning

The debate converged on framing Aragora as **Automated Adversarial Validation** / **AI Red Team for decisions**.

**10-word pitch:**
"AI red team attacks your plan before reality does."

**Primary buyer:**
Accountable decision owners: CTOs, CISOs, staff engineers, compliance/risk leaders.

## Key Insights

The debate process:
- Produced a crisp wedge and removed ambiguity around "multi-agent debate" as the product
- Clarified that the **debate is the engine**; the **product is the stress-test output** (receipt, risk heatmap, mitigations)

## Decisions Made

- **Positioning:** Lead with "adversarial validation" and "AI red team," not "debate"
- **Product surface:** Make Gauntlet the default workflow for high-stakes reviews
- **Output format:** Emphasize Decision Receipts, evidence, and auditability
- **Buyer value:** Sell insurance against expensive mistakes, not AI novelty

## Risks Identified

- **False confidence:** Consensus can still be wrong; enforce evaluation and calibration
- **Trust barrier:** Buyers need evidence of reliability; publish benchmarks
- **Over-automation:** Self-modifying flows require explicit human approvals
- **Scope creep:** Keep the wedge narrow; avoid becoming a generic agent toolkit

## Rejected Alternatives

The debate also surfaced and rejected weaker framings:
- **"AI Diplomat" / consensus-builder:** Low urgency; feels like a vitamin
- **Courtroom/Supreme Court metaphors:** Authority and liability concerns
- **Compliance-only positioning:** Useful but too narrow as sole focus

## Takeaway

This demonstrates using Aragora for strategic decisions - not just technical review. The adversarial process forced sharper thinking and produced a more actionable positioning than solo brainstorming.
