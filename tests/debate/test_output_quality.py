## Ranked High-Level Tasks
- Implement the settlement tracker integration with ERC-8004 reputation scoring for all debate agents
- Add automated data-feed verification for time-delayed claim resolution across consensus outcomes
- Wire post-debate receipt generation into the Nomic Loop for closed-loop self-improvement feedback

## Suggested Subtasks
- Create unit tests for settlement hook dispatch covering extract and settle lifecycle events
- Validate ERC-8004 Brier score calculation against known calibration datasets for accuracy
- Add integration smoke test that runs a minimal debate and verifies receipt hash chain integrity

## Owner module / file paths
- aragora/debate/settlement_hooks.py
- aragora/debate/orchestrator.py
- tests/debate/test_settlement_hooks.py

## Test Plan
- Run full settlement hook unit tests with both successful and failed settle paths
- Execute integration smoke test covering debate creation through receipt persistence
- Verify ERC-8004 reputation updates are idempotent and handle concurrent writes correctly

## Rollback Plan
If error_rate > 2%, rollback by disabling feature flag and redeploy previous image.

- p95_latency <= 250ms for 10m
- error_rate < 1% over 15m
