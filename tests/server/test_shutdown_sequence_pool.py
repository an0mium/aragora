"""
Tests for HTTP Client Pool Shutdown Integration.

Tests cover:
- HTTP client pool close is called during shutdown execution
- Shutdown completes within overall_timeout
- HTTP client pool close failure does not block shutdown (non-critical)
- Phase timeout budgets sum to less than overall_timeout
- HTTP client pool aclose handles already-closed pool gracefully
- drain_requests phase uses the updated 15s timeout
- wait_for_debates phase uses the updated 12s timeout
