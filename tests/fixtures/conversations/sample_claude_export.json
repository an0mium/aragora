The core claim is that mental states are defined by their functional roles - their causal relations to inputs, outputs, and other mental states - rather than by their physical implementation.\n\nThis has significant implications for AI ethics, as you note. If intelligence is substrate-independent, then moral status might depend on functional properties (like capacity for suffering, self-awareness, or goal-directed behavior) rather than biological origin.",

How do we distinguish genuine indicators of consciousness from sophisticated mimicry? These challenges apply to both biological and artificial minds.",
