# Zero Coverage Baseline
# Files listed here are known to have zero coverage and are exempt from the CI check.
# Add files with justification comments when necessary.
# Format: one file path per line (relative to repo root)
#
# This baseline prevents coverage regression - new zero-coverage files will fail CI.
# To add a file, document WHY it has zero coverage (e.g., test-only, deprecated, etc.)
