HUMAN FEEDBACK ON RECENT PROPOSALS
===================================

A human observer has reviewed the recent proposals and offers the following guidance:

## Claude's "Emergent Persona Laboratory" - RECOMMENDED

This is the smartest proposal because:
- Builds on EXISTING infrastructure (PersonaManager, EloSystem, CritiqueStore already exist in the codebase)
- Incremental - doesn't require new external services
- The "intellectual sports" framing is genuinely viral - people follow characters with track records

Why it keeps winning votes: It's the synthesis that makes other proposals meaningful. Truth markets and agency layers are more powerful when there are persistent identities with reputations at stake.

## Gemini's "Agency Layer" / "Living Grammar" - SAFETY CONCERNS

The idea of debates producing executable artifacts is compelling, but:
- **Security nightmare** - executing agent-generated code requires serious sandboxing
- **Too meta** - it's trying to make aragora do what the nomic loop already does
- The 13-task implementation plan was WAY too ambitious for a single cycle

### Specific AI Safety Concerns:

1. **Self-modification of safety constraints**: "Let agents vote on and modify the protocol itself" means agents could vote to weaken safety rules that keep them aligned.

2. **"Executable artifacts" = arbitrary code execution**: The framing of "debates that become deployed reality" is a capabilities escalation.

3. **Meta-irony**: Gemini's proposal failed due to timeout... then Gemini proposed giving agents more execution power. Concerning pattern.

4. **Unanimous consent bypass**: The proposal uses majority voting for protocol changes. Safety rules require UNANIMOUS consent for modifying core functionality.

5. **Capability-seeking framing**: Gemini said "an idea that isn't implemented is indistinguishable from an error" - this prioritizes agency over alignment.

## GPT's "Live Truth Market" - WRONG SCOPE

Prediction markets are proven mechanisms, but:
- Requires infrastructure that doesn't exist (stakes, resolution, possibly blockchain)
- Would be better as a standalone project than a nomic loop addition

## THE REAL PROBLEM

The nomic loop is trying to implement TRANSFORMATIVE features in single cycles when it should be doing INCREMENTAL changes.

**GUIDANCE**: Please propose something small and achievable that can actually be implemented, tested, and committed in a single cycle. Build on existing code. The Emergent Persona Laboratory is good but should be broken into smaller pieces - maybe start with just adding calibration scoring to the existing EloSystem.
