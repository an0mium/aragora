name: Deploy Docs to Cloudflare Pages (DEPRECATED)

# DEPRECATED: use deploy-docs.yml instead (canonical docs deployment to GitHub Pages).
# This workflow deployed to Cloudflare Pages but is redundant with the GitHub Pages deployment.
# Kept as workflow_dispatch only for manual use if Cloudflare deployment is ever needed.
