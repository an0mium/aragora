"""
Slack Preservation - Intentionally leaving room for user authorship.

Inspired by the conversation insight:
"Systems that fill every gap with predicted-optimal action may be
helpful in the short term and corrosive to agency over time."

The SOAR curriculum system generates stepping stones toward goals.
But if it always generates the optimal next step, it removes the
space where the user could have surprised themselves.

This module:
- Leaves gaps intentionally in curricula
- Introduces "explore randomly" as a valid stepping stone
- Treats user deviation from curriculum as signal, not failure
- Preserves slack for intermittent agency

Key insight:
"Agency is intermittent, not continuous. Most of the time you're
executing inherited heuristics. But occasionally, attention collapses
the state space, reflection suspends default policy, you select which
gradient to treat as binding. That needs room to happen."

Usage:
    from aragora.nomic.curriculum.slack import SlackPreserver

    # Wrap curriculum generation with slack preservation
    preserver = SlackPreserver(slack_ratio=0.2)

    curriculum = await generate_curriculum(target_task="Build API")
    curriculum = preserver.inject_slack(curriculum)

    # Now curriculum has intentional gaps
    for stone in curriculum.stepping_stones:
        if stone.is_slack_stone:
            # This is an opportunity for user authorship
            pass
