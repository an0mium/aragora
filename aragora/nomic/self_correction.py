"""Self-correcting improvement loop for the Nomic autonomous orchestrator.

Analyzes patterns across Nomic Loop cycles to adjust future behavior.
The engine learns from success/failure outcomes and produces actionable
recommendations: track priority adjustments, agent rotation, and
strategy changes.

Three correction mechanisms:
1. Track prioritization: boost successful tracks, deprioritize failing ones
2. Agent selection: prefer agents that contributed to successful outcomes
3. Strategy adaptation: switch approaches when patterns indicate failure

Usage:
    from aragora.nomic.self_correction import SelfCorrectionEngine

    engine = SelfCorrectionEngine()
    report = engine.analyze_patterns(outcomes)
    adjustments = engine.compute_priority_adjustments(report)
