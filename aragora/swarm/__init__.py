"""Swarm Commander: interrogate -> spec -> dispatch -> merge -> report.

The swarm module provides a user-facing wrapper around Aragora's existing
orchestration infrastructure. It adds an interrogation phase (gathering
requirements from non-developer users) and a reporting phase (explaining
results in plain English).

Usage:
    from aragora.swarm import SwarmCommander, SwarmSpec, SwarmReport

    # Full lifecycle
    commander = SwarmCommander()
    report = await commander.run("Make the dashboard faster")
    print(report.to_plain_text())

    # From pre-built spec
    spec = SwarmSpec.from_yaml(Path("my-spec.yaml").read_text())
    report = await commander.run_from_spec(spec)

    # Dry run (spec only, no dispatch)
    spec = await commander.dry_run("Improve test coverage")
