"""Review Adjudicator (M0, epic #8747 / issue #8748).

Escapes the PR-review "nitpick treadmill" — two adversarial reviewers who never
both PASS a substantial diff, each surfacing fresh advisory ``[P2]/[P3]`` nits —
by *adjudicating the findings themselves* instead of hand-refereeing round after
round. It **composes** existing Aragora primitives (it does NOT reimplement
them):

* :class:`EvidenceQualityAnalyzer` — scores a finding's specificity /
  concreteness / evidence diversity. Prefer the legacy ``aragora_debate``
  package when installed, otherwise use Aragora's in-tree analyzer.
* :func:`aragora.cli.commands.review_queue_comment_verdicts.has_blocking_finding_or_label`
  — the SAME ``[P0]/[P1]`` detector the gate already trusts (the hard bar).

The adjudicator fires ONLY on a stall (quorum unsatisfied, dissent present, at
least one supportive signal) and returns one of:

* ``SETTLE``   — all dissent is thin (below the groundedness bar): the treadmill
  escape. Findings are preserved for follow-up, never discarded. By default,
  grounded advisory-only dissent is also capped here to honor severity-gated
  dissent; callers may explicitly promote grounded advisory findings to BLOCK.
* ``BLOCK``    — any ``[P0]/[P1]`` is present, OR a grounded advisory finding
  stands with no grounded counter-support under the explicit promotion policy.
  Never suppress a real hard-bar finding.
* ``ESCALATE`` — grounded dissent AND grounded support both exist: a genuine
  two-sided material disagreement that a human should settle (a crux). M0 emits
  a summary escalation; crux-finder bridging (#8747) is a fast-follow.
* ``NOT_APPLICABLE`` — no dissent, or no supportive signal (genuine rejection is
  not a stall). The adjudicator abstains and the existing gate decides.

The groundedness score is a deterministic heuristic composed from the analyzer's
sub-scores (see :func:`score_groundedness`). It is intentionally a fast, cheap
first pass; a fast-follow can plug :class:`aragora.evaluation.llm_judge.LLMJudge`
as the scorer for "real intelligence" on the ambiguous middle. The bias is
conservative: SETTLE requires *every* dissenting finding to be clearly thin unless
the explicit advisory-severity policy caps grounded advisory-only dissent as
follow-up. Hard-bar ``[P0]/[P1]`` findings still always block.

Gated behind ``ARAGORA_ENABLE_REVIEW_ADJUDICATOR`` (default OFF → byte-identical
to today).
