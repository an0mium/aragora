Defines the core TaskBrief data structure.

This module provides a concrete, versioned schema for tasks that are processed
by the Aragora system. It serves as the validated output of the ambiguity
resolution pipeline and the primary input for debate and execution phases.

    A structured, versioned representation of a task.

    Attributes:
        goal: The primary objective of the task. Must be a non-empty string.
        schema_version: The version of the TaskBrief schema.

        success_criteria: A list of conditions that define task completion.
        confidence: A score from 0.0 to 1.0 indicating the system's
            confidence in the interpretation of the task. Defaults to 0.0.
        provenance: A dictionary containing metadata about the task's origin.
        assumptions: A list of assumptions made during task interpretation.
        requires_user_confirmation: If True, the orchestrator must halt
            and await explicit user approval before execution.
