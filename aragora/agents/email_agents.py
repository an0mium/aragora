Email-Specific Agent Personas for Intelligent Inbox Management.

Specialized agents for email prioritization debates:
- SenderReputationAgent: Analyzes sender importance and relationship
- ContentUrgencyAgent: Detects time-sensitive content and deadlines
- ContextRelevanceAgent: Cross-references with user's activities
- BillingCriticalityAgent: Identifies financial/contract-related emails
- TimelineAgent: Considers user's schedule and response patterns

These agents participate in multi-agent debates to reach consensus on
email priority, providing transparent decision receipts.
