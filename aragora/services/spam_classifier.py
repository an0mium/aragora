"""
ML-Enhanced Spam Classification Service.

This module is a backwards-compatibility shim that re-exports all public
APIs from the ``aragora.services.spam`` package.  The implementation has
been refactored into focused submodules:

- ``aragora.services.spam.models``    -- data classes and enums
- ``aragora.services.spam.patterns``  -- pattern constants and word lists
- ``aragora.services.spam.features``  -- feature extraction engine
- ``aragora.services.spam.model``     -- Naive Bayes ML classifier
- ``aragora.services.spam.classifier``-- main SpamClassifier and convenience functions

All names previously importable from ``aragora.services.spam_classifier``
remain importable from this module.

Usage (unchanged):
    from aragora.services.spam_classifier import SpamClassifier

    classifier = SpamClassifier()
    await classifier.initialize()

    # Classify an email
    result = await classifier.classify_email(email)
    print(f"Spam: {result.is_spam} (confidence: {result.confidence})")

    # Train from user feedback
    await classifier.train_from_feedback(email_id, is_spam=True)

    # Use with email dict
    email_dict = {
        "id": "msg_123",
        "subject": "You won!",
        "body": "Click here to claim...",
        "sender": "prize@suspicious.tk",
        "headers": {...},
        "attachments": ["prize.exe"]
    }
    result = await classify_email(email_dict)
