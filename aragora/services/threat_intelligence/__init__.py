Threat Intelligence Integration Service.

Provides unified access to external threat intelligence feeds for:
- URL/attachment scanning (VirusTotal)
- IP reputation checking (AbuseIPDB)
- Phishing URL detection (PhishTank)
- Malware URL detection (URLhaus)

Features:
- Async API clients with rate limiting
- Tiered caching (1h for IPs, 24h for URLs) with Redis backend option
- Confidence scoring and threat classification
- Batch scanning capabilities with dict[str, ThreatResult] return
- Aggregate scoring from multiple sources with weighted confidence
- Event emission for high-risk findings
- Integration with email prioritization
- Fallback handling when APIs are unavailable

Usage:
    from aragora.services.threat_intelligence import ThreatIntelligenceService

    service = ThreatIntelligenceService(
        virustotal_api_key="your-key",
        abuseipdb_api_key="your-key",
    )

    # Check a URL
    result = await service.check_url("https://suspicious-site.com")
    if result.is_malicious:
        print(f"Threat detected: {result.threat_type}")
