"""
ML-Enhanced Spam Classification Service.

Provides machine learning-based spam detection with online learning
from user feedback. Falls back to rule-based classification when
model confidence is low.

Features:
- Feature extraction from email content, headers, and sender patterns
- Domain reputation scoring (known spam domains, free email providers)
- Subject line analysis (spam keywords, excessive punctuation, ALL CAPS ratio)
- Content n-grams (unigrams, bigrams) for statistical classification
- Header analysis (missing headers, suspicious routing, authentication)
- URL analysis (shortened URLs, suspicious domains, redirect detection)
- Attachment analysis (dangerous extensions, executable files)
- Online learning from user actions (mark as spam, not spam)
- Confidence scoring with fallback to heuristics
- Persistent model storage
- Batch classification support
- Integration with EmailPrioritizer for inbox scoring

Usage:
    from aragora.services.spam import SpamClassifier

    classifier = SpamClassifier()
    await classifier.initialize()

    # Classify an email
    result = await classifier.classify_email(email)
    print(f"Spam: {result.is_spam} (confidence: {result.confidence})")

    # Train from user feedback
    await classifier.train_from_feedback(email_id, is_spam=True)

    # Use with email dict
    email_dict = {
        "id": "msg_123",
        "subject": "You won!",
        "body": "Click here to claim...",
        "sender": "prize@suspicious.tk",
        "headers": {...},
        "attachments": ["prize.exe"]
    }
    result = await classify_email(email_dict)
