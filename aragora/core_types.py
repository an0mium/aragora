    """Defines a task environment for multi-agent debate.

    The Environment specifies what problem to solve and constraints on how
    the debate should proceed. This is one of the three core inputs to Arena
    (along with agents and protocol).

    Attributes:
        task: The problem, question, or goal to debate. Required, non-empty,
            max 100,000 characters (~15k words). Cannot contain null bytes.
        context: Additional background information to provide to all agents.
            Use for domain knowledge, constraints, or prior decisions.
        roles: List of cognitive roles to assign. Defaults to
            ["proposer", "critic", "synthesizer"]. Common roles include:
            - proposer: Generates solution proposals
            - critic: Identifies issues and weaknesses
            - synthesizer: Combines proposals into unified answers
            - judge: Evaluates and scores proposals
            - analyst: Deep-dives on specific aspects
        success_fn: Optional scoring function (str -> float 0-1) to evaluate
            proposals. If provided, used to guide consensus toward
            higher-scoring answers.
        max_rounds: Maximum debate rounds before forced termination.
            Defaults to 3. Higher values allow more refinement but
            increase cost and latency.
        require_consensus: If True, debate continues until consensus or
            max_rounds. If False, may terminate early on strong agreement.
        consensus_threshold: Fraction of agents that must agree for
            consensus (0.0-1.0). Default 0.7 means 70% agreement required.
        documents: List of document IDs to attach to this debate for
            evidence grounding. Documents are fetched and provided to
            agents during the debate.

    Validation:
        - task must be non-empty
        - task cannot exceed MAX_TASK_LENGTH (100,000 chars)
        - task cannot contain null bytes (security measure)
