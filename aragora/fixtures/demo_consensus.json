    "conclusion": "A real-time web interface that visualizes multi-agent debates as they happen, generating unique shareable URLs for each debate session. Extends the existing export/static_html.py artifact export system, adds WebSocket streaming to push rounds in real-time, and generates permalink slugs. Implementation scope: ~300 lines Python (WebSocket server + permalink generation), ~200 lines HTML/JS (viewer component).",

Transforms aragora from a fragile system that crashes when an agent fails, into a resilient system that observes failures and continues. Implementation in aragora/agents/airlock.py with injection via AgentFactory.",
