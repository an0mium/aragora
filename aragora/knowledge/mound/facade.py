"""
Knowledge Mound Facade - Unified knowledge storage with production backends.

This is the main entry point for the enhanced Knowledge Mound system,
providing a unified API over multiple storage backends (SQLite, PostgreSQL, Redis)
and integrating staleness detection and culture accumulation.

The facade is composed from modular mixins:
- core.py: Initialization, lifecycle, storage adapters
- api/crud.py: Create, read, update, delete operations
- api/query.py: Query and search operations
- api/rlm.py: RLM (Recursive Language Models) integration
- ops/staleness.py: Staleness detection and revalidation
- ops/culture.py: Culture accumulation and management
- ops/sync.py: Cross-system synchronization

Phase A2 Operations:
- ops/contradiction.py: Contradiction detection and resolution
- ops/confidence_decay.py: Dynamic confidence adjustment over time
- ops/governance.py: RBAC and audit trail logging
- ops/analytics.py: Coverage, usage, and quality analytics
- ops/extraction.py: Knowledge extraction from debates

Usage:
    from aragora.knowledge.mound import KnowledgeMound, MoundConfig

    config = MoundConfig(
        backend=MoundBackend.POSTGRES,
        postgres_url="postgresql://user:pass@localhost/aragora",
        redis_url="redis://localhost:6379",
    )

    mound = KnowledgeMound(config, workspace_id="enterprise_team")
    await mound.initialize()

    # Store knowledge with provenance
    result = await mound.store(IngestionRequest(
        content="All contracts must have 90-day notice periods",
        source_type=KnowledgeSource.DEBATE,
        debate_id="debate_123",
        confidence=0.95,
        workspace_id="enterprise_team",
    ))

    # Query semantically
    results = await mound.query("contract notice requirements", limit=10)

    # Check staleness
    stale = await mound.get_stale_knowledge(threshold=0.7)

    # Get culture profile
    culture = await mound.get_culture_profile()
