"""
PerformanceAdapter - Unified adapter for agent performance metrics.

This module re-exports all public APIs from the
``aragora.knowledge.mound.adapters.performance`` subpackage for
backwards compatibility.  The implementation has been split into
focused submodules:

- ``performance/models.py``        -- Data classes
- ``performance/elo_storage.py``   -- ELO rating/match/calibration storage & retrieval
- ``performance/expertise.py``     -- Domain expertise tracking with caching
- ``performance/reverse_flow.py``  -- KM-to-ELO pattern analysis & adjustments
- ``performance/km_persistence.py``-- Knowledge Mound sync/load
- ``performance/search.py``        -- Search, fusion, semantic search implementations
- ``performance/adapter.py``       -- Main PerformanceAdapter class

Usage (unchanged):
    from aragora.knowledge.mound.adapters import PerformanceAdapter

    adapter = PerformanceAdapter()

    # Store performance data
    adapter.store_rating(rating, debate_id="d-123")
    adapter.store_agent_expertise("claude", "security", 1650, delta=50)

    # Query expertise
    experts = adapter.get_domain_experts("security", limit=5)

    # Analyze KM patterns
    patterns = await adapter.analyze_km_patterns_for_agent("claude", km_items)
