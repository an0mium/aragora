"""
Routing - Agent selection and decision routing.

Provides:
- Adaptive agent selection for optimal team composition
- Domain detection and auto-routing
- Unified decision routing (Gateway + Core integration)

The unified router chains Gateway (business logic) with Core (execution):
    Request → Gateway Router → Core Router → Result
           (business criteria)  (engine selection)

Usage:
    # Agent selection
    from aragora.routing import AgentSelector, TeamBuilder

    # Decision routing
    from aragora.routing import UnifiedDecisionRouter, route_decision_auto
