"""Due settlement event listener.

Subscribes to due settlement events from the SettlementReviewScheduler
and performs three actions:

1. Logs the due settlement for audit trail.
2. Emits a notification event that the notification service can pick up.
3. Records the review-due status in the settlement store via the tracker.

This module is wired into the scheduler's ``on_review_due`` callback
during server startup (see ``init_debate_settlement_scheduler``).
