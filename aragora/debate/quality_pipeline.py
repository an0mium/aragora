"""
Shared post-consensus quality pipeline.

This module provides a single entry-point that both the CLI and server
debate paths can call after consensus to apply deterministic quality
checks and repairs.  It intentionally does NOT include LLM upgrade loops
(those are optional and live in the CLI path) -- the pipeline here is
pure-deterministic and fast.

The pipeline stages are:
1. Derive or load an OutputContract from the task / caller config.
2. Validate the consensus answer against the contract.
3. Apply deterministic quality repairs for common structured-output defects.
4. Finalize the JSON payload section (if required by the contract).
5. Re-validate and return a quality report alongside the (possibly improved) answer.
