"""
Shared type definitions for the debate package.

This module provides common type aliases, TypeVars, and Protocol classes
used across the debate package to:
- Reduce TYPE_CHECKING import blocks
- Provide single source of truth for debate-related types
- Enable cleaner imports in phase modules

Usage:
    from aragora.debate.types import AgentType, DebateContextType, PhaseProtocol

    # In function signatures
    def process(ctx: DebateContextType, agent: AgentType) -> None: ...

    # In class definitions
    class MyPhase(PhaseProtocol):
        name = "my_phase"
        async def execute(self, ctx: DebateContextType) -> None: ...
