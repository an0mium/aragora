- crud: CRUD operations mixin (list, get, update, delete)
- diagnostics: Debate diagnostics for self-service debugging
- evidence: Citations, evidence, and verification reports mixin
- export: Export format operations mixin
- fork: Fork and follow-up debate operations mixin
- graph_debates: Graph-based multi-party debates
- matrix_debates: Matrix debate format
