"""Workspace-to-Pipeline bridge for execution history deduplication.

Queries workspace beads for recently completed work that matches a given
goal or topic, allowing the Idea-to-Execution pipeline to skip stages
that have already been accomplished.

The bridge uses keyword matching against bead titles and descriptions to
find related past work, then produces a ``WorkspaceContext`` summarising
what was already done, what goals can be skipped, and how long ago each
piece of work was completed.

Usage:
    bridge = WorkspacePipelineBridge()
    ctx = await bridge.query_context("Implement rate limiter")
    if "implement rate limiter" in ctx.completed_goals:
        print("Already done!")
