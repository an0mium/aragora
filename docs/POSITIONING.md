# Aragora: Product Positioning Brief

*Strategic positioning for B2B market validation*

---

## What Aragora Is

**Aragora is an AI red team and decision stress-test engine** that attacks high-stakes plans (specs, architectures, policies, code) and produces audit-ready Decision Receipts with evidence and dissent.

### Core Value Proposition

> "Aragora attacks your plan before reality does."

Debate is the internal combustion engine. The product is a defensible decision record.

---

## What Aragora Is NOT

- **Not a chatbot** - No consumer-facing conversational UI
- **Not a wrapper** - Not another LLM API aggregator
- **Not a general debate product** - Debate is internal, outputs are outcomes
- **Not autonomous code change in production** - The Nomic loop is experimental and review-gated

---

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Adversarial Validation + Decision Receipts
- Red-team attacks, probes, and scenario tests
- Tamper-evident receipts with evidence chains and dissent trails

### 2. Multi-Model Dissent as Signal
- Heterogeneous models required
- Consensus and disagreement are quantified and surfaced

### 3. Regulatory Stress-Testing
- Built-in personas (GDPR, HIPAA, AI Act, SOX, PCI, NIST, SOC 2)

### 4. Formal Verification (When Needed)
- Z3 SMT solver and Lean prover for provable claims

### 5. Nomic Loop (Experimental)
- Self-improving system behind review gates and checkpoints

---

## Target Customers

### Primary: Accountable Decision Owners
- CTOs, chief architects, staff/principal engineers
- CISOs, security leaders, threat model owners
- Compliance and risk officers

### Secondary: Engineering and Product Teams
- Architecture reviews and design sign-off
- Policy and regulatory pre-checks
- Pre-release risk audits

### Tertiary: Research and Policy
- Think tanks and labs validating complex proposals

## Competitive Landscape

| Solution | Adversarial Validation | Audit Artifact | Multi-Model Dissent | Formal Verification |
|----------|------------------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Aragora** | Yes | Yes (DecisionReceipt) | Yes | Yes |
| Multi-agent frameworks | Limited | No | Optional | No |
| Human review/consulting | Yes | Yes (reports) | N/A | Rare |
| Traditional pentesting | Runtime only | Yes (reports) | N/A | No |

---

## Deployment Model

- **Self-hosted**: Full control, data stays on-premise
- **API-first**: Integrate with existing workflows
- **Provider-agnostic**: Works with any LLM backend
- **Stable entry points**: `aragora gauntlet`, `aragora ask`, `aragora serve`
- **Experimental**: Nomic loop and self-modifying workflows (review-gated)
