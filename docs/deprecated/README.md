# Deprecated Documentation

This folder contains historical or superseded documentation. These files are
kept for reference but are no longer maintained. For current guidance, use the
canonical docs in the main `docs/` directory.

## Index

- `api/` - Legacy endpoint inventories and cleanup notes.
- `database/` - Superseded database migration notes.
- `engineering/` - Completed refactoring notes.
- `enterprise/` - Historical feasibility studies.
- `guides/` - Older guides replaced by current docs.
- `migrations/` - Legacy migration guides for versions no longer supported.
- `release-notes/` - Point-in-time release notes.

## Policy

If a document is superseded, replace it with a pointer in the active docs and
move the original here. Keep filenames stable to preserve references in PRs or
issue history.
