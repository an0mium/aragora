## What Actually Works

These claims are verified by code review and test execution against the actual codebase.

### Core Debate Engine

The debate engine is real, functional, and battle-tested.

`Arena.run()` orchestrates genuine multi-agent debates with real LLM API calls. Agents from different providers -- Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Mistral, xAI -- actually critique each other's reasoning in structured rounds.

| Capability | Detail |
|---|---|
| Agent types | 43 across 8 categories: CLI (8), API Direct (7), OpenRouter (16), Fine-tuned (4), Framework (5), Demo (1), Local (2) |
| Phase execution | 7 phases: Context Init, Proposals, Debate Rounds, Consensus, Verification, Analytics, Feedback |
| Consensus modes | 5: judge, majority, supermajority, unanimous, ELO-weighted |
| Cognitive roles | 9 rotations: Analyst, Skeptic, Lateral Thinker, Devil's Advocate, Synthesizer, Domain Expert, Red Team, Pragmatist, Visionary |
| Team selection | 15+ dimensions for intelligent agent composition |
| Fallback | Circuit breaker with OpenRouter fallback on 429 rate limits |
| Hollow consensus | Trickster detection: 3-phase evidence quality analysis with intervention |
| Decision receipts | SHA-256 hashing in Markdown, HTML, SARIF, CSV formats |
| ELO rankings | Domain-specific ratings, Brier score calibration, persistent leaderboards |
| Demo mode | Works end-to-end with no API keys required |
| CLI | `aragora review`, `aragora gauntlet` work in both live and demo modes |
| Test coverage | 213,000+ automated tests, 0 mypy type errors |

### Idea-to-Execution Pipeline (90% Working)

The pipeline converts raw ideas into executable multi-agent plans across four stages.

| Stage | Status | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Ideas | Fully working | Converts raw ideas to Canvas nodes with radial layout |
| 2. Goals | Fully working | SMART scoring, conflict detection, KM precedent enrichment |
| 3. Actions | Fully working | Template-based decomposition into 20+ action steps with dependency graphs |
| 4. Orchestration | Partially working | Generates multi-agent execution plans with ELO-ranked agent assignment. Real execution when engines available; returns "planned" status otherwise (graceful degradation, not failure) |

- CLI: `aragora pipeline run "Build a rate limiter"` works.
- Tests: All 9 pipeline smoke tests pass in 0.6s.
- Known gap: Pipeline results are in-memory only (not persisted across restarts).

### Enterprise Security and Compliance

This is production-grade infrastructure, not prototyping code.

| Area | Scale | Key Capabilities |
|---|---|---|
| RBAC | 12,969 LOC | 390+ permissions, 165+ resource types |
| Billing | 23,114 LOC | Stripe integration, metering, forecasting |
| Observability | 17,280 LOC | Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry tracing, Grafana dashboards |
| Authentication | Production | OIDC/SAML SSO, MFA (TOTP/HOTP), SCIM 2.0 provisioning |
| Encryption | Production | AES-256-GCM at rest, automated 90-day key rotation |
| Compliance frameworks | 9 | HIPAA, GDPR, PCI-DSS, SOX, ISO 27001, OWASP, FDA 21 CFR Part 11, FedRAMP, NIST 800-53 |
| EU AI Act | Production | Article 12/13/14 artifact generation |
| Handler tests | 19,776 | 0 failures |

### Knowledge and Memory

| System | What It Does |
|---|---|
| Continuum Memory | 4-tier (Google's Nested Learning): FAST 1h, MEDIUM 24h, SLOW 7d, GLACIAL 30d with surprise-driven tier transitions |
| Knowledge Mound | 34 bidirectional adapters creating federated knowledge graph across 7 subsystems |
| ConsensusMemory | Cross-debate institutional learning |
| CritiqueStore | Post-mortem critique-to-fix pattern extraction |

### SDKs and API

| Component | Scale |
|---|---|
| Python SDK | 184 namespaces, 5,800+ methods |
| TypeScript SDK | 183 namespaces, 3,700+ methods (99.3% parity) |
| REST API | 3,000+ operations across 2,900+ paths |
| WebSocket events | 190+ event types for real-time streaming |

## What's Partially Working

These capabilities exist and function in part, but have gaps between documented claims and current reality.

### Convergence Detection

- **Documentation claims:** "3-tier similarity detection" (syntactic, semantic, domain).
- **Reality:** Only tier 1 (syntactic text similarity via `difflib.SequenceMatcher`) is implemented in the core convergence path.
- Semantic embeddings are lazy-loaded but not wired into the convergence pipeline.
- **Impact:** Convergence detection works, but relies on surface-level text matching rather than deep semantic understanding. Debates may fail to detect convergence when agents agree in meaning but differ in phrasing.

### Self-Improvement System (Nomic Loop) -- 60% Implemented

The self-improvement infrastructure is substantial (80K+ LOC) but the main orchestrator isn't wired to the real implementations.

**What works in isolation:**

| Component | LOC | Status |
|---|---|---|
| DebatePhase | 792 | Real Arena orchestration |
| ImplementPhase | -- | Real file writing + syntax validation |
| VerifyPhase | -- | Real pytest execution |
| CommitPhase | -- | Real git operations |
| TaskDecomposer | -- | Heuristic + debate decomposition |
| MetaPlanner | -- | Debate-driven prioritization |
| KMFeedbackBridge | -- | Cross-cycle learning persistence |

**What's broken:** `loop.py` -- the main orchestrator -- has stub phase methods that return hardcoded success values like `return {"consensus": True, "confidence": 0.8, "proposals": []}`. The real phase implementations exist in `aragora/nomic/phases/` but `loop.py` doesn't instantiate them.

**What's missing:** BranchCoordinator git operations are mostly stubbed. ForwardFixer diagnoses failures but doesn't apply fixes. No integration test proves the full cycle from goal to code to tests to commit.

**Evidence from git history:** All "nomic" commits are infrastructure improvements to the system itself -- not code generated by an autonomous cycle.

**Assessment:** The structure and pieces are there, but the wiring hasn't been connected. This is approximately 50 lines of integration code away from functioning, not a fundamental architecture gap.

### Formal Verification

- Z3 SMT solver works for decidable claims.
- Lean 4 translation is available but optional.
- Semantic alignment checking prevents hallucinated proofs.
- Only used for high-stakes decisions (opt-in), not a general-purpose feature.

---

## What's Scaffolding

These are areas where claims need honest qualification. The code exists, but the capability as marketed overstates current reality.

### "Blockchain/Immutable Receipts"

| Claim | Reality |
|---|---|
| Immutable blockchain receipts | SHA-256 hashes with no on-chain storage |
| Distributed ledger | No distributed consensus mechanism for receipts |
| ERC-8004 agent identity | Contracts exist as code but have not been deployed |
| Tamper-proof records | Deterministic outputs with integrity checking, not tamper-proof immutable records |

**Honest framing:** Decision receipts have cryptographic integrity verification (SHA-256). They are deterministic, reproducible, and auditable. They are not immutable in the blockchain sense. The value is in the structured audit trail, not in the ledger.

### "43-Agent Parallel Coordination"

| Claim | Reality |
|---|---|
| 43 agents running in parallel | All 43 types exist and work individually |
| Massive parallelism | Running all 43 simultaneously hits provider rate limits |
| Practical limit | 2-6 agents per debate for real-time, up to 10 for batch |

**Honest framing:** The value is heterogeneity -- different models from different providers challenge each other's reasoning, reducing correlated blind spots. The value is NOT raw parallelism. A debate with Claude + GPT-4 + Gemini + Mistral is more valuable than one with 43 copies of Claude.

### "Self-Improving Platform"

| Claim | Reality |
|---|---|
| Autonomous self-improvement | 80K+ LOC infrastructure exists; individual components are well-tested |
| 21+ self-improvement phases | More accurately describes manual development iterations, not autonomous agent-driven cycles |
| Proven autonomous cycles | The system has never autonomously completed a full improvement cycle in production |

**Honest framing:** Aragora has the most sophisticated self-improvement infrastructure of any open agent framework. The pieces individually work and are tested. The end-to-end autonomous cycle is not yet proven. This is a wiring problem, not an architecture problem.

## Defensible Value Proposition

### What Aragora Has That Cannot Be Easily Replicated

#### 1. Adversarial Debate + Audit Receipts (THE CORE MOAT)

No other framework combines structured adversarial multi-agent debate with cryptographic decision receipts. LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, and OpenAI Agents SDK all do cooperative task completion. None produce audit-ready decision records.

This is a new category: **Decision Integrity.**

Why it resists commoditization:

- It is architecturally different from cooperative frameworks. Adversarial vs. cooperative is a design philosophy, not a feature toggle.
- The receipt format, dissent tracking, and evidence chains create a document standard that represents years of domain expertise.
- 210+ debate modules encode deep knowledge of structured argumentation that cannot be bolted onto a cooperative framework.

#### 2. Heterogeneous Model Consensus as Bias Countermeasure

Using Claude + GPT + Gemini + Mistral together reduces correlated blind spots. This is not just "use multiple models." It is structured disagreement with tracked dissent, weighted voting, and hollow consensus detection (Trickster).

No funded competitor does this.

#### 3. Calibrated Trust (ELO + Brier)

Agents build track records over time. Per-domain ELO ratings and Brier score calibration mean the system learns which agents are reliable for which types of decisions.

This creates a flywheel: more debates produce better calibration, which produces higher-quality consensus, which drives more debates.

#### 4. Regulatory Timing (EU AI Act)

EU AI Act high-risk enforcement begins **August 2, 2026**. Companies deploying AI in regulated industries need documented validation and audit trails.

Aragora's Decision Receipts are designed to satisfy:

| Article | Requirement | Aragora Capability |
|---|---|---|
| Article 12 | Record-keeping | Full debate transcripts with agent attribution |
| Article 13 | Transparency | Decision factor decomposition, counterfactual analysis |
| Article 14 | Human oversight | Approval gates, spectator mode, veto capability |

This creates a compliance-driven adoption wedge that bigger companies cannot ignore.

#### 5. BYOK Economics

Customers bring their own API keys. Aragora never marks up LLM costs.

| Model | Pricing Approach | Gross Margin Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Inference resellers | 2-3x markup on LLM costs | Margins compress as inference costs drop |
| Aragora (BYOK) | Zero LLM markup; revenue from platform | 85%+ gross margins from day one |

Aragora's model scales without COGS pressure because the product is the orchestration and audit trail, not the inference.

## What Will Be Eaten by Bigger Companies

Be honest about where Aragora should NOT try to compete:

| Capability | Who Wins | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Generic agent orchestration | LangGraph | Backed by LangChain ecosystem, massive community |
| Cooperative task automation | CrewAI | Simpler model, faster adoption for basic use cases |
| Single-model tool use | OpenAI Agents SDK | Native integration with the dominant model provider |
| Basic RAG/retrieval | Everyone | Commoditized; no differentiation possible |
| Simple chatbot integrations | Everyone | Table stakes, not a product |

**Strategic implication:** Do not compete on these axes. Competing on general-purpose agent orchestration is a losing game against well-funded incumbents with larger communities. Win on what they cannot easily replicate.

## How to Strengthen the Moat

### Immediate (Next 30 Days)

| Priority | Action | Effort | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Wire the self-improvement loop: replace `loop.py` stubs with real phase instantiation | ~50 LOC | Transforms "we have self-improvement infrastructure" into "we can self-improve" |
| 2 | Ship PyPI package: `pip install aragora-debate` | Package config | Developer adoption wedge; standalone debate engine with zero configuration |
| 3 | GitHub Actions integration: pre-built CI gate for PR review | ~200 LOC | Gets Aragora into developer workflows where decisions happen daily |

### Near-Term (30-90 Days)

| Priority | Action | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| 4 | Add real semantic convergence: replace difflib with sentence-transformer embeddings for tier-2 | Makes convergence detection meaningful rather than surface-level |
| 5 | Case studies: run Aragora on real PRs in public repos, publish "before/after" comparisons | Demonstrates what adversarial debate catches that single-model review misses |
| 6 | EU AI Act compliance package: bundle receipt generation + compliance artifacts into a single command | Positions Aragora as the compliance solution before enforcement date |

### Medium-Term (90-180 Days)

| Priority | Action | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| 7 | Marketplace: agent templates, workflow templates, vertical-specific packages | Creates ecosystem lock-in and community contribution |
| 8 | Enterprise pilots: 3-5 design partners in regulated industries (FinTech, HealthTech, LegalTech) | Validates pricing, surfaces real requirements, generates case studies |
| 9 | Cloud marketplace listings: AWS, GCP, Azure | Enterprise discovery and procurement compliance |

## The Bottom Line

### What Is Real

Aragora's core value proposition is **real and defensible**: multi-agent adversarial debate that produces audit-ready decision receipts.

- The debate engine works.
- The receipts work.
- The CLI works.
- The API works.
- The enterprise security works.
- 213,000+ tests prove it.

This combination is unique. No funded competitor does it. It represents a new category -- Decision Integrity -- not a feature added to an existing category.

### What Needs Honest Qualification

| Gap | Severity | Fix Effort |
|---|---|---|
| Self-improvement loop not wired end-to-end | Medium | ~50 LOC of integration code |
| Convergence detection is syntactic only | Low | Swap difflib for sentence-transformers |
| "Blockchain" receipts are SHA-256 hashing | Low | Reframe messaging; the audit trail is the value |
| 43-agent parallelism is theoretical | Low | Reframe around heterogeneity, not parallelism |

These are fixable gaps, not fundamental flaws. The architecture supports all the claimed capabilities; the wiring needs to be completed in specific areas.

### The Strategic Insight

Do not try to compete on general agent orchestration. LangGraph wins that game.

Do not try to be the simplest multi-agent framework. CrewAI wins that game.

Win on **decision quality, auditability, and compliance** -- the category Aragora created.

The EU AI Act creates a regulatory forcing function that makes this category inevitable. Every company deploying AI in high-risk domains will need documented decision validation and audit trails. Aragora is built for exactly this.

**Be the standard before someone else is.**
