        **How it works:** Aragora selects the best agents for your topic (or uses your

        explicit list), runs adversarial rounds where agents propose, critique, and revise

        positions, then detects consensus and generates an audit-ready decision receipt.


        **Rate Limit:** 10 debates per day (free), 100/day (pro), unlimited (enterprise)


        **Concurrent Limit:** 1 concurrent debate (free), 5 (pro), 20 (enterprise)


        **WebSocket:** After creation, connect to the returned `websocket_url` to stream

        real-time debate progress (proposals, critiques, votes, consensus events).'

                  - Agent gpt-4o did not participate - verify OPENAI_API_KEY is set and valid
                  - No consensus reached after 3 rounds - consider increasing round count or reducing agent count
                  - Consider adding OPENROUTER_API_KEY as fallback for failed providers

        **Purpose:** Start a full decision workflow: gather context, run a multi-agent debate

        with domain-appropriate agents, generate compliance artifacts, and deliver a decision

        receipt through configured output channels.


        **Authentication:** Required. The run will be owned by the authenticated user.


        **Response:** Returns a run object with status `queued`. The execution proceeds

        asynchronously -- poll the run status or connect via WebSocket for real-time updates.


        **Rate Limit:** 10 runs per hour (free), 100/hour (pro), unlimited (enterprise).'

        **Purpose:** Critical for first-time SME onboarding. Before reading docs about

        42 agent types, call this single endpoint to see exactly what is missing.


        **No authentication required** -- intentionally open so brand-new users can

        call it before any credentials are set up.


        **Response includes:**

        - `ready_to_debate` -- boolean indicating if at least one required provider is configured

        - Per-provider availability (anthropic, openai, openrouter, mistral, gemini, xai)

        - Missing required and optional API key names

        - Storage backend type and status

        - Feature availability flags (debates, receipts, knowledge_mound, memory, etc.)'
