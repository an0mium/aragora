| Deprecated endpoints (excluded) | 574 | - | - |

## Scope Notes

- Coverage excludes deprecated endpoints from the OpenAPI total.
- `/api` is normalized to `/api/v1` for SDK comparisons.
- `sdk/typescript` primarily targets `/api` with `/api/v1` aliases.
- `aragora-py` targets `/api/v1` endpoints.
- `aragora-js` is a lightweight `/api/v1` client (reported below for reference).
