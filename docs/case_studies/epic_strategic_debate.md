# Epic Strategic Debate (Case Study)

**Context**
Aragora ran a 12-agent, multi-phase strategic debate to stress-test its own positioning. The goal was to converge on a defensible, high-value category narrative and identify the clearest buyer/problem fit.

**Inputs**
- Debate prompt: “What should Aragora be, who is it for, and why now?”
- 12 heterogeneous agents across multiple model providers
- Structured phases: Pitch → Roast → Defense → Synthesis → Verdict

**Outcome (Consensus Positioning)**
Aragora is best framed as **Automated Adversarial Validation** / **AI Red Team for decisions**.

**10‑word pitch**
“AI red team attacks your plan before reality does.”

**Primary buyer**
Accountable decision owners: CTOs, CISOs, staff engineers, compliance/risk leaders.

**What this validates**
The debate produced a crisp wedge and removed ambiguity around “multi‑agent debate” as the product. The **debate is the engine**; the **product is the stress‑test output** (receipt, risk heatmap, mitigations).

## Key Decisions
- **Positioning:** Lead with “adversarial validation” and “AI red team,” not “debate.”
- **Product surface:** Make Gauntlet the default workflow for high‑stakes reviews.
- **Output format:** Emphasize Decision Receipts, evidence, and auditability.
- **Buyer value:** Sell insurance against expensive mistakes, not AI novelty.

## Risks & Caveats
- **False confidence:** Consensus can still be wrong; enforce evaluation and calibration.
- **Trust barrier:** Buyers need evidence of reliability; publish benchmarks.
- **Over‑automation:** Self‑modifying flows require explicit human approvals.
- **Scope creep:** Keep the wedge narrow; avoid becoming a generic agent toolkit.

## Dissenting Views (Why Rejected)
- **“AI Diplomat” / consensus‑builder framing:** Low urgency; feels like a vitamin.
- **Courtroom/Supreme Court metaphors:** Authority and liability concerns.
- **Compliance‑only positioning:** Useful but too narrow; better as a vertical.

## Evidence of Utility
The debate uncovered blind spots in the original feature‑driven narrative, forced a sharper “red team” framing, and produced a buyer‑aligned pitch that is demonstrably more actionable.
