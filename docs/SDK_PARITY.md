## Executive Summary

| Metric | OpenAPI | sdk/typescript | aragora-py |
|--------|---------|----------------|------------|
| Total endpoints | 692 | 2046 | 1971 |
| Covered endpoints | - | 552 | 534 |
| Coverage | - | 79.8% | 77.2% |
| Deprecated endpoints (excluded) | 330 | - | - |

## Scope Notes

- Coverage excludes deprecated endpoints from the OpenAPI total.
- `/api` is normalized to `/api/v1` for SDK comparisons.
- `sdk/typescript` primarily targets `/api` with `/api/v1` aliases.
- `aragora-py` targets `/api/v1` endpoints.
- `aragora-js` is a lightweight `/api/v1` client (reported below for reference).
