# Aragora: Design Partner Program

**Stop shipping decisions you can't explain.**

---

## The Problem

Your team uses AI every day — generating code, drafting plans, evaluating options.
But when something goes wrong, nobody can answer: *why did we decide that?*

- **No audit trail.** AI outputs are ephemeral. Decisions evaporate.
- **Single-model blind spots.** One LLM = one perspective. No adversarial vetting.
- **Compliance gaps.** Regulators want explainability. You have chat logs.

## What Aragora Does

Aragora is a **Decision Integrity Platform**. It orchestrates multiple AI agents
to adversarially vet decisions, then delivers audit-ready **decision receipts**
to any channel.

```
Your question → 42 agents debate → Consensus + receipt → Slack / GitHub / API
```

**Three things that make it different:**

1. **Multi-agent consensus.** Claude, GPT-4, Mistral, Gemini debate each decision.
   Disagreements surface blind spots before they become incidents.

2. **Cryptographic receipts.** Every decision produces a SHA-256 signed receipt
   with agent votes, agreement scores, and provenance chains.

3. **Zero-config autonomous actions.** Point it at your GitHub repo and it
   reviews PRs, identifies next steps, and posts findings — no setup required.

## Who This Is For

We're looking for **3-5 design partners** who:

- Ship software with AI assistance (Copilot, Claude, Cursor, etc.)
- Need to explain AI-assisted decisions to stakeholders or regulators
- Want autonomous code review beyond what a single LLM provides
- Are willing to give candid feedback in exchange for early access

**Ideal verticals:** FinTech, HealthTech, Legal Tech, GovTech, or any
regulated industry where decision provenance matters.

## What We're Asking

| From You | From Us |
|----------|---------|
| 30 min onboarding call | Free access during partner period |
| Run on 1-2 real repos | Priority feature requests |
| 15 min feedback call every 2 weeks | Direct Slack access to the team |
| Permission to use anonymized case study | Co-marketing opportunity |
