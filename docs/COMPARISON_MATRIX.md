## Where Competitors Are Stronger

### LangGraph
- **Orchestration flexibility**: LangGraph's graph-based state machine is more flexible for arbitrary agent workflows. Aragora's workflow engine covers common patterns but is not its primary focus.
- **Ecosystem**: LangChain's 100+ integrations and massive community provide more out-of-the-box connectors for niche use cases.
- **Observability**: LangSmith provides mature tracing, evaluation, and monitoring that has been battle-tested at scale.
- **Documentation**: Extensive tutorials, cookbooks, and community examples.

### CrewAI
- **Simplicity**: CrewAI's decorator-based API (`@agent`, `@task`, `@crew`) is the simplest way to get a multi-agent system running. Lower barrier to entry.
- **Growth trajectory**: Rapid adoption and community growth. Active development cadence.
- **Focus**: Does one thing (cooperative teams) well without trying to be everything.

### AutoGen
- **Research foundation**: Backed by Microsoft Research with academic rigor in conversation pattern design.
- **Flexibility**: Highly configurable conversation patterns for diverse multi-agent scenarios.
- **Corporate backing**: Microsoft's resources for long-term maintenance and enterprise adoption.

### OpenAI Agents SDK
- **Simplicity**: Minimal API surface for single-provider agent workflows.
- **Tool integration**: Native function calling with OpenAI's tool infrastructure.
- **Adoption**: OpenAI's developer reach means rapid adoption.
- **Guardrails**: Built-in input/output validation.

## The Bottom Line

If you need **cooperative task automation** with maximum ecosystem breadth, use LangGraph or CrewAI.

If you need **decisions that are adversarially vetted, calibrated, and audit-ready**, use Aragora.

If you need both, use them together -- route your agent team's output through Aragora before it ships.
