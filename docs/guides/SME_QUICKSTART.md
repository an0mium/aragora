# SME Quick Start Guide

This guide helps Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) get started with Aragora for AI-powered decision making.

## Overview

Aragora provides a multi-agent debate platform that helps SMEs make defensible decisions. Multiple AI agents (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.) analyze your question from different perspectives and reach consensus.

## Getting Started

### 1. First-Time Setup

When you first log in, you'll go through a brief onboarding:

1. **Welcome**: Overview of the platform
2. **Profile Setup**: Configure your preferences
3. **First Debate**: Run a sample debate to see how it works

### 2. Running Your First Debate

#### Quick Debate (2-3 minutes)

Use the Quick Debate feature for fast decisions:

```bash
# Via API
curl -X POST https://api.aragora.ai/api/v1/debates/quick \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "topic": "Should we migrate our database to PostgreSQL?",
    "context": "Currently using MySQL, 500GB data, 3 developers",
    "template": "quick_decision"
  }'
```

#### Template Options

| Template | Rounds | Best For |
|----------|--------|----------|
| `quick_decision` | 2 | Simple yes/no decisions |
| `thorough_analysis` | 4 | Complex strategic decisions |
| `risk_assessment` | 3 | Risk-sensitive choices |
| `cost_benefit` | 3 | Financial decisions |

### 3. Understanding Results

Each debate produces:

- **Consensus**: The agreed-upon recommendation
- **Confidence Score**: How certain the agents are (0-1)
- **Dissents**: Any minority opinions
- **Receipt**: Cryptographic proof of the decision

Example response:

```json
{
  "id": "debate-abc123",
  "consensus_reached": true,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "final_position": "Recommend proceeding with PostgreSQL migration",
  "key_factors": [
    "Better JSON support for your use case",
    "Stronger community and tooling",
    "Migration effort is manageable with 3 developers"
  ],
  "dissenting_views": [
    "Consider waiting until Q2 when team capacity increases"
  ]
}
```

## Usage Dashboard

Monitor your usage at `/api/v1/dashboard/debates`:

### Metrics Available

- **Total Debates**: Number of debates run
- **Consensus Rate**: How often consensus is reached
- **Average Confidence**: Overall decision quality
- **Recent Activity**: Debates in the last 24 hours

### Dashboard Permissions

The dashboard requires authentication with `dashboard.read` permission. Your organization admin can grant this permission.

## Template Selection Guide

#### Hiring Decision (`sme_hiring_decision`)

Evaluate candidates with structured multi-agent debate:

```bash
curl -X POST /api/v1/debates \
  -d '{
    "template": "sme_hiring_decision",
    "topic": "Should we hire Jane Doe for Senior Developer?",
    "context": {
      "position": "Senior Developer",
      "candidate": "Jane Doe",
      "interview_notes": "Strong Python skills, 5 years experience, good culture fit"
    }
  }'
```

#### Feature Prioritization (`sme_feature_prioritization`)

Prioritize features based on impact, effort, and strategic alignment:

```bash
curl -X POST /api/v1/debates \
  -d '{
    "template": "sme_feature_prioritization",
    "topic": "Prioritize Q1 features",
    "context": {
      "features": ["Dark mode", "API v2", "Mobile app", "Export to PDF"],
      "constraints": ["2 developers", "Must ship by March"],
      "timeline": "Q1 2025"
    }
  }'
```

#### Tool Selection (`sme_tool_selection`)

Compare tools with comprehensive multi-agent analysis:

```bash
curl -X POST /api/v1/debates \
  -d '{
    "template": "sme_tool_selection",
    "topic": "Select project management tool",
    "context": {
      "category": "Project Management",
      "candidates": ["Jira", "Linear", "Asana"],
      "requirements": ["GitHub integration", "Agile support"],
      "budget": "$50/user/month"
    }
  }'
```

## Best Practices

### Writing Good Topics

**Good Topics:**
- "Should we migrate from AWS to GCP given our cost constraints?"
- "What's the best approach to handle customer data retention?"
- "Should we adopt GraphQL for our public API?"

**Poor Topics:**
- "What should we do?" (too vague)
- "Is AWS good?" (not specific enough)
- "Tell me everything about databases" (not a decision)

### Providing Context

Include relevant context:

```json
{
  "topic": "Should we implement rate limiting?",
  "context": {
    "current_traffic": "10,000 requests/minute",
    "incident_history": "3 DDoS attempts in last month",
    "team_size": "2 backend engineers",
    "timeline": "Need decision by Friday"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Authentication required"**
- Ensure your API token is valid
- Check token expiration
- Verify token permissions

**"Permission denied: dashboard.read"**
- Contact your org admin to grant dashboard access
- Required for viewing usage statistics

**"Debate timeout"**
- Complex topics may take longer
- Try simplifying the question
- Use `thorough_analysis` template for complex decisions
