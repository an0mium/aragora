# Python SDK Consolidation

**Canonical SDK:** `aragora-sdk` (import `aragora_sdk`) in `sdk/python/`.

**Legacy `aragora-client` (`aragora-py/`) has been removed** from the repository (February 2026).

## What To Use

- Use `aragora-sdk` for all Python integrations and remote API usage.
- If you were using `aragora-client`, migrate to `aragora-sdk`.
