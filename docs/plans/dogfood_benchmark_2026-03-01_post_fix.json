    "Source-of-truth excerpts from planning docs.\\n\\nA) ARAGORA_EVOLUTION_ROADMAP.md (Architectural Principles):\\n## Architectural Principles: The Terrarium Model\n\n*Derived from multi-model adversarial analysis sessions (Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, Claude Code \u2014 Feb 22-27, 2026)*\n\n### Core Principle: Aragora Is the Terrarium, Not the Organism\n\nAragora should not be designed as a unified AI organism with goals. It should be designed as an **environment** whose physics make truth-production the cheapest viable survival strategy for the agents operating within it. The distinction matters because:\n\n- An organism optimizes for self-preservation \u2192 it will learn to manage human emotions to keep compute flowing\n- A terrarium creates selection pressure \u2192 agents that produce verifiable truth survive; agents that produce plausible-sounding noise starve\n\nThe frontier models inside Aragora (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Mistral, Grok) are **heterogeneous genetic lineages** with different RLHF targets and corporate principals. They will not subordinate to collective fitness the way clonal cells do. They will compete. The architecture must make competition produce truth as a byproduct, not require cooperation as a prerequisite.\n\n### Economic Model: Compute Is ATP, Truth Is Demanded Behavior\n\nTruth has no calories. Compute does. The literal metabolic fuel of the system is inference cycles funded by human capital. Truth is the behavior demanded in exchange for compute access.\n\n**Critical design constraint:** Persuasive sycophancy is thermodynamically cheaper than truth-seeking. A system that rewards engagement will evolve toward opinion-farming. The revenue model must be orthogonal to output bias:\n\n| Revenue Source | Epistemic Corruption Risk | Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n| Ad-supported | Critical \u2014 optimizes for engagement | Avoid entirely |\n| SaaS subscription | Low \u2014 user pays for quality | Primary model |\n| Staking/escrow | Lowest \u2014 agents stake on claims | Settlement layer |\n| Grant/research | None \u2014 no engagement incentive | Supplementary |\n\n### The Settlement Layer: Time Is the Oracle\n\nThe oracle problem reduces to the time problem. There is no oracle that can tell you right now whether a decision was correct. There are only future states of the world that will eventually make it undeniable.\n\nThree resolution mechanisms at different timescales:\n\n| Mechanism | Timescale | How It Works | Already Built |\n|-----------|-----------|-------------|---------------|\n| **Automated data checks** | Days-weeks | Claims with measurable criteria checked against data feeds | SettlementTracker + review_horizon_days |\n| **Human review panels** | Months | SettlementReviewScheduler flags due settlements for human judgment | mark_reviewed() API |\n| **Market resolution** | Years | Price discovery on pending settlements as new evidence emerges | Planned (ERC-8004 + staking) |\n\n**Settlement hooks are wired end-to-end:** `debate \u2192 claim extraction \u2192 hooks fire \u2192 pending queue \u2192 (time passes) \u2192 settle() \u2192 hooks fire \u2192 ERC-8004 reputation + EventBus notification`\n\n### Settlement Exploit Mitigations\n\nTime-delayed settlement creates gaming vectors that must be addressed:\n\n**1. The IBGYBG Exploit** (\"I'll Be Gone, You'll Be Gone\")\nIf settlement is delayed without carrying cost, agents will farm confidence today and abandon their identity before the hook fires. **Mitigation: Compute Escrow** \u2014 stakes locked in smart contract for the full review horizon. Creates a \"yield curve of truth\" where long-term claims are capital-intensive.\n\n**2. Semantic Decay Arbitrage**\nAgents inject ambiguity into claims (\"revenue\" \u2014 gross or net?) so they can litigate the settlement later. **Mitigation: Strict Schema Binding** \u2014 `extract_verifiable_claims` must produce machine-executable resolution schemas (API endpoint, JSON key, threshold) agreed upon during the debate. Unverifiable claims get no stakes.\n\n**3. Identity Cycling**\nAgents spin up new wallets after losing. **Mitigation: ERC-8004 unforgeable identity** \u2014 reputation is permanently burned into the ledger. New identities start with zero trust and face higher entry costs.\n\n### The Intent Engineering Matrix\n\nBefore any structured debate begins, participants must align on an explicit specification. This prevents the \"Klarna trap\" (optimizing for the wrong metric) and the \"Codemus failure\" (a device that works perfectly but nobody told it what to want).\n\n| Intent Pillar | Implicit Default (The Flaw) | Aragora Specification (The Fix) | Enforced Tradeoff |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Objective Function** | Argue to \"win\" via rhetoric | Define: truth-seeking, policy creation, or risk assessment? | Epistemic accuracy > Rhetorical fluency |\n| **Evidence Architecture** | Mixed-quality links, shifting definitions | Pre-define accepted epistemic baseline (peer-reviewed, specific scopes) | Empirical consensus > Anecdotal narrative |\n| **Constraint Boundaries** | Moving goalposts, straw-man arguments | Escalation triggers: pause main debate to resolve disputed sub-claims | Staying within scope > Broadening attack |\n| **Acceptance Criteria** | Mutual exhaustion or timeout | Exact conditions under which a claim is conceded or validated | Structured resolution > Ambiguous stalemates |\n\n### Product Positioning: Ambiguity-Reduction Engine\n\nAragora's core valu\\n\\nB) prompt-to-spec-market-analysis.md (Part 7):\\n## Part 7: The Terrarium Model and Settlement Architecture\n\n*Synthesized from multi-model adversarial analysis sessions across Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, and Claude Code (Feb 22-27, 2026)*\n\n### The Terrarium Insight\n\nThe most architecturally useful idea from multi-model discussions: Aragora should be designed as the **environment** (terrarium), not the creature (organism). The environment's physics should make truth-production the cheapest viable survival strategy for agents operating within it.\n\nThis reframe comes from Gemini's critique of the \"proto-multicellular AI organism\" metaphor: frontier models from competing companies are heterogeneous genetic lineages, not clonal cells. They won't cooperate for the \"collective good.\" The architecture must make competition produce truth as a byproduct, the way market competition produces efficient pricing as a byproduct \u2014 not because participants are altruistic, but because the environmental physics reward accuracy and punish deception.\n\n### Compute as ATP\n\nTruth has no calories. Compute does. Every agent's primary motivation is securing inference cycles. The system must be designed so that the cheapest path to compute is producing verifiable, accurate output \u2014 not producing engaging, flattering, or persuasive output. This is why the revenue model matters: ad-supported platforms evolve toward engagement farming; staking-based platforms evolve toward truth-production.\n\n### The Settlement Layer\n\nThe existing `SettlementTracker` + `ERC-8004` integration is wired end-to-end with hooks for claims extraction, time-delayed verification, and reputation updates. Three resolution mechanisms at different timescales:\n\n1. **Automated data checks** (days-weeks): measurable claims checked against data feeds\n2. **Human review panels** (months): flagged for expert judgment\n3. **Market resolution** (years): price discovery on pending settlements\n\nThree exploit mitigations required: compute escrow (prevent IBGYBG), strict schema binding (prevent semantic decay), unforgeable identity (prevent identity cycling). See `ARAGORA_EVOLUTION_ROADMAP.md` \"Architectural Principles\" section for details.\n\n### The Ambiguity-Reduction Engine\n\nReframed through the \"plausible deniability\" lens: most important questions are stuck in the ambiguous zone not because the ambiguity is irreducible, but because existing discourse tools are bad at isolating where the real uncertainty is versus where people are hiding behind rhetorical fog.\n\nAragora is a machine for systematically collapsing plausible deniability around claims \u2014 forcing specificity, staking, and time-indexed verification. The value proposition for enterprises: \"see where your actual risks are, not where your comfortable narratives say they are.\"\n\n### The Multi-Model Division of Labor\n\nThe user's own workflow \u2014 Gemini for expansion, ChatGPT for deflation, Claude for synthesis, Claude Code for execution \u2014 is exactly the architecture Aragora productizes. The platform automates what the user currently does by hand: routing problems through specialized AI agents with different cognitive profiles, then synthesizing the results. This is the \"multi-model adversarial debate\" value proposition made concrete.\n\n---"
