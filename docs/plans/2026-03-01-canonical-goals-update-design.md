# Canonical Goals Document Update Design

**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Status:** Approved and implemented

## Summary

Updated `~/Development/aragoradocs/ARAGORA_CANONICAL_GOALS.md` to include a comprehensive Foundational Thesis section that defines WHAT Aragora is and WHY, establishing it as the authoritative source for project direction. The Evolution Roadmap (`docs/plans/ARAGORA_EVOLUTION_ROADMAP.md`) remains the HOW document.

## What Changed

### New Sections Added (above Priority Stack)

1. **Mission Statement** -- Single paragraph capturing Aragora's identity
2. **Six Foundational Pillars** -- Core ideas that all features must trace to:
   - P1: Adversarial Heterogeneous Consensus
   - P2: SME and Regulated Vertical Accessibility
   - P3: Vague Intent to Autonomous Execution (with DAG pipeline)
   - P4: Regulatory Audit Trail
   - P5: Self-Repair and Self-Improvement
   - P6: OpenClaw Integration for Controlled Agentic Execution
3. **Architectural Principles** -- Terrarium Model, Compute Is ATP, Time Is Settlement Layer, Intent Engineering Matrix, Ambiguity-Reduction Engine positioning
4. **Integration Commitments** -- OpenClaw, Ethereum/ERC-8004, essay-derived goals, aragoradocs goals, unrealized claims table
5. **Philosophical Foundations** -- Essay principles, multi-model cognitive division, variance preservation
6. **Evolution Roadmap Goals** -- Phase summary with pillar mapping, north-star outcomes

### Existing Sections Updated

- Priority Stack: Added Pillar column to all goals, added new goals (#18-19 in P2, #27-28 in P3, #29-38 in new P4)
- Honest Qualifications: Each now cross-references the specific goal that addresses it
- Key Risks: Added engagement-corruption and settlement-gaming risks
- Document Map: Added Related Codebase Documents section

## Sources Synthesized

- User's six foundational ideas
- Essay: "AI, Evolution, and the Myth of Final States" (anomium.substack.com)
- Multi-model conversation (Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT) on truth arbitrage, terrarium model, settlement mechanisms
- Evolution Roadmap phases and goals
- Aragoradocs folder (20 documents)
- Honest Assessment unrealized claims
- Existing canonical goals document

## Relationship to Other Documents

- **Supersedes:** Goal sections in all aragoradocs files
- **Implemented by:** `docs/plans/ARAGORA_EVOLUTION_ROADMAP.md`
- **Aligned with:** `docs/FOCUS.md` (tier-based investment priority)
- **Referenced by:** `CLAUDE.md` (agent integration guide)
