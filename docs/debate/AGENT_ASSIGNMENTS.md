## Quick Start Templates

### For Claude Code Sessions

Copy-paste when starting a session:

```
I'm working on Aragora. Check .claude/COORDINATION.md first.

I want to work on: [TRACK NAME] track
Specifically: [ISSUE NUMBER or DESCRIPTION]

Before changing code:
1. Tell me your plan in plain language
2. List the files you'll modify
3. Wait for my OK

After changes:
1. Run tests: pytest tests/ -x --timeout=60 -m "not slow"
2. Update .claude/COORDINATION.md
3. Commit with descriptive message
```

### For Codex Sessions

```
Project: Aragora (multi-agent AI decision platform)
Task: [SPECIFIC TASK]
Constraints:
- Only modify files in: [FOLDER LIST]
- Run tests before committing
- Keep changes focused and small
```

## Checking for Conflicts

Before starting work, run:

```bash
# See what's changed recently
git log --oneline -10

# See uncommitted changes
git status

# See who's working on what
cat .claude/COORDINATION.md
```

If you see unexpected changes, ask before proceeding.
