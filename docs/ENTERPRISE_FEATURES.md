## Authorization (RBAC v2)

Fine-grained role-based access control with hierarchical permissions.

### Permission Model

Permissions are defined as `(ResourceType, Action, Scope)` tuples:

- **16 resource types**: Debate, Agent, Workflow, Document, Memory, Culture, KnowledgeNode, AuditSession, AuditFinding, TrainingJob, SpecialistModel, Workspace, Organization, Billing, APIKey
- **8 actions**: Create, Read, Update, Delete, Execute, Export, Share, Admin
- **4 scope levels**: Global, Organization, Workspace, Resource

**390+ named permissions** across all resource domains, including debates, agents, users, organizations, API keys, memory, workflows, analytics, knowledge, provenance, connectors, devices, repositories, webhooks, gauntlet, marketplace, explainability, findings, decisions, policies, compliance, control plane, finance, receipts, scheduling, billing, sessions, approvals, templates, roles, backups, disaster recovery, data governance (classification, retention, lineage, PII), computer use, and more.

### Default Roles

| Role | Scope | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Superadmin** | Global | Full system access across all resources and scopes |
| **Org Admin** | Organization | Full access within an organization |
| **Workspace Admin** | Workspace | Full access within a workspace |
| **Workspace Editor** | Workspace | Create, read, update, delete on debates, documents, workflows, and memory |
| **Workspace Viewer** | Workspace | Read-only access to all workspace resources |
| **Auditor** | Workspace | Create, read, and execute audit sessions; read audit findings and documents |
| **ML Engineer** | Organization | Full CRUD on training jobs and specialist models |

Custom roles can be created with any combination of permissions. Roles support hierarchy -- a workspace admin inherits all workspace editor permissions.

### Enforcement

```python
from aragora.rbac.decorators import require_permission
from aragora.rbac.models import AuthorizationContext

@require_permission("backups:read")
async def get_backups(ctx: AuthorizationContext) -> list:
    return await manager.list_backups()
```

- **Decorators**: `@require_permission` and `@require_role` for route-level enforcement
- **Middleware**: HTTP middleware validates route permissions against `SYSTEM_PERMISSIONS` registry at startup; logs warnings for undefined permissions
- **Caching**: `PermissionChecker` with LRU caching for fast repeated checks
- **Audit logging**: All authorization decisions (grant and deny) are recorded

Implementation: `aragora/rbac/models.py`, `aragora/rbac/types.py`, `aragora/rbac/checker.py`, `aragora/rbac/decorators.py`, `aragora/rbac/middleware.py`, `aragora/rbac/audit.py`, `aragora/rbac/defaults/`

The `proposer_agent` parameter enables attack/defend cycles where a designated agent defends the specification while adversarial agents probe for weaknesses.

### Full Debate Trace

Every debate action is recorded with:

- Agent identity and provider
- Timestamp (UTC, microsecond)
- Action type (propose, critique, revise, vote, synthesize)
- Content (full text of each contribution)
- Severity scores (for critiques)
- Vote weights (calibrated by ELO and Brier scores)
- Correlation IDs for end-to-end tracing

Traces integrate with OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing across the full request lifecycle.
