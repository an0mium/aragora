## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is the open source version limited?**
No. The full debate engine, all 43 agent types, code review, gauntlet, CLI, SDKs, and API are included in the MIT-licensed open source package. Commercial tiers add managed infrastructure, enterprise auth, and compliance tooling.

**Do I need API keys from LLM providers?**
Yes. Aragora orchestrates models from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI, Mistral, and others. You bring your own API keys. Demo mode (`--demo`) works without keys for evaluation.

**What's included in "managed deployment"?**
We run a dedicated Aragora instance on your cloud account (AWS, GCP, or Azure). You get automatic updates, monitoring, and backup without managing infrastructure. Your data stays in your account.

**How does EU AI Act compliance work?**
Aragora generates Article 12 (Record-Keeping), Article 13 (Transparency), and Article 14 (Human Oversight) compliance artifact bundles from your decision receipts. These are audit-ready documents for conformity assessment under the EU AI Act (effective August 2, 2026).

**Can I try before buying?**
Yes. Install the open source package (`pip install aragora`), run `aragora review --demo`, and evaluate the full platform. Upgrade when you need enterprise features or managed deployment.
