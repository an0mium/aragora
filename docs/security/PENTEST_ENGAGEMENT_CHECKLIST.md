### Communication Setup
- [ ] Establish Slack/Teams channel for real-time comms
- [ ] Share emergency contact list
- [ ] Define escalation procedures
- [ ] Schedule kickoff meeting

### Internal Readiness
- [ ] Brief engineering team on testing window
- [ ] Alert ops team to expected testing traffic
- [ ] Ensure monitoring dashboards are accessible
- [ ] Prepare incident response contacts

## Phase 3: Active Testing (Week 1-3)

### Daily Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor application logs for testing activity
- [ ] Track API error rates (expected to increase)
- [ ] Watch for unexpected service degradation
- [ ] Review daily finding summaries from vendor

### Finding Triage (As Findings Arrive)
- [ ] Critical findings: Acknowledge within 4 hours
- [ ] High findings: Review within 24 hours
- [ ] Medium/Low: Queue for post-engagement review
- [ ] Confirm reproduction steps for each finding

### Mid-Engagement Review
- [ ] Schedule mid-point status call
- [ ] Review preliminary findings
- [ ] Adjust scope if needed
- [ ] Confirm remaining testing areas

---

## Phase 4: Remediation (Week 4-6)

### Immediate Actions (Critical/High)
- [ ] Create tracking tickets for all findings
- [ ] Assign owners to each finding
- [ ] Prioritize remediation by risk score
- [ ] Begin fixing Critical findings immediately
- [ ] Document compensating controls where applicable

### Remediation Tracking

| Finding ID | Severity | Status | Owner | ETA |
|------------|----------|--------|-------|-----|
| PENT-001 | Critical | In Progress | - | - |
| PENT-002 | High | Not Started | - | - |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Retest Coordination
- [ ] Schedule retest window with vendor
- [ ] Provide evidence of fixes for each finding
- [ ] Obtain retest confirmation/signoff

---

## Phase 5: Post-Engagement (Week 6-8)

### Documentation & Reporting
- [ ] Receive final report from vendor
- [ ] Review and confirm accuracy of findings
- [ ] Request executive summary for stakeholders
- [ ] Archive all testing artifacts securely

### Compliance Evidence
- [ ] Obtain attestation letter from vendor
- [ ] Extract SOC 2 evidence:
  - Final report (redacted if needed)
  - Retest confirmation
  - Remediation evidence
- [ ] Update security documentation
- [ ] Update risk register with findings

### Knowledge Transfer
- [ ] Conduct internal debrief session
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Update security testing procedures
- [ ] Plan for next assessment cycle

### Vendor Feedback
- [ ] Complete vendor evaluation form
- [ ] Schedule future engagement (if applicable)
- [ ] Provide testimonial/reference (if positive)
