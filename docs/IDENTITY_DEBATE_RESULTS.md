## Identity Debate v2 (Adopted Positioning)

**Date:** 2026-01-23

**Consensus:** Reached (Confidence: 80%)

**Duration:** 172s (5 rounds)

**Participants:** claude, gemini, grok, deepseek, mistral, qwen, kimi

### Winning Proposal (Gemini)

**Tagline (10 words):**  
Aragora: Multi-agent debate AI; evolving knowledge, synthesizing truth.

**Description (47 words):**  
Aragora's 15+ model ensemble debates multimodal data (25+ formats, 24 connectors) within a Hegelian framework, building self-improving institutional memory for defensible decisions via multi-platform communication (Slack/Teams).

### Adopted Positioning

**Tagline:**  
Control plane for multi-agent robust decisionmaking across org knowledge and channels.

**Short Description:**  
Orchestrate 15+ AI models to debate organizational knowledge, deliver defensible decisions to any channel, and retain institutional memory with audit trails.

## Final Answer

## Final Synthesis

**Question:** 
Define Aragora's core identity in a single compelling sentence.

## Context
You are debating the identity of Aragora, a 710K+ line codebase with 43,500+ tests.
A previous debate produced a tagline that was criticized for underemphasizing key capabilities.
Your task is to improve upon it.

## Key Capabilities to Emphasize (often overlooked)
1. **Omnivorous Data Ingestion**: 25+ document formats, images, audio, video, 24 data connectors
2. **Institutional Memory**: 4-tier memory, surprise-based retention, Knowledge Mound, cross-session learning
3. **Bidirectional Communication**: Receives queries AND sends results to Slack, Discord, Teams, Telegram, WhatsApp, voice
4. **Debate & Synthesis**: Hegelian dialectics (Thesis->Antithesis->Synthesis), multi-agent consensus
5. **Long Context Mastery**: RLM programmatic navigation, million-token contexts, REPL-like interface
6. **Self-Improvement**: Nomic Loop (debate->design->implement->verify with constitutional constraints)

## What Makes Aragora Unique (vs ChatGPT/Copilot)
- NOT a chatbot: Structured debate protocol with phases, roles, and evidence chains
- NOT a copilot: Institutional learning that ACCUMULATES organizational knowledge
- NOT single-model: Heterogeneous 15+ provider ensemble that argues toward truth
- NOT stateless: Remembers outcomes, builds knowledge graphs, improves itself
- NOT text-only: Multimodal ingestion + multi-channel bidirectional output

## Perspectives to Consider
1. **Technical**: What does the system actually do at its core?
2. **Business**: What problem does it solve for enterprises?
3. **Philosophical**: What is its intellectual foundation?
4. **Competitive**: How is it different from other AI tools?

## Deliverables
1. ONE recommended tagline (under 15 words) - must capture MORE than just "debate"
2. ONE full description (under 50 words) - must mention data ingestion AND institutional memory
3. Brief justification for why this framing is most compelling

Focus on what's unique and defensible, not generic AI buzzwords.


### Combined Perspectives

**gemini_creative:**
Okay, I acknowledge the critiques of my previous proposal [cite: 7.4]. The term "debate-driven AI architecture" doesn't sufficiently convey the structured nature of Aragora's debate protocol, potentially blurring the lines with adversarial AI or LLMs claiming debate capabilities. The "knowledge evolution" framing also lacks the specificity needed to highlight Aragora's unique institutional memory mechanics.

Here's my revised proposal, attempting to address these issues by emphasizing the structured nature of the debate and the accumulation of knowledge over time:

**Tagline:** Aragora: The structured debate AI that builds institutional knowledge, decision by decision.

**Description:** Aragora ingests multimodal data and synthesizes insights via structured debate, retaining knowledge acro
