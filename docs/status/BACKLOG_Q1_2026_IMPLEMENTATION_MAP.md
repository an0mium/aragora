# BACKLOG_Q1_2026 Implementation Map (Owners + Files)

Last updated: 2026-02-12

This document maps the backlog items in `docs/status/BACKLOG_Q1_2026.md` to:
- suggested owners (by role),
- primary code/doc locations,
- concrete "definition of done" gates.

It is intended to be used during sprint planning and PR review so work lands in the right place and can be validated.

Related:
- Canonical execution order + CI gates: `docs/status/NEXT_STEPS_CANONICAL.md`
- SME wedge spec: `docs/status/SME_STARTER_PACK.md`
- Design partner program: `docs/status/DESIGN_PARTNER_PROGRAM.md`
- PMF scorecard: `docs/status/PMF_SCORECARD.md`

---

## Owner Roles (Suggested)

- Product: defines scope + success metrics + partner feedback loop
- Backend (Core): server handlers, orchestration, receipts, analytics
- Backend (Connectors): Slack/Gmail/Drive/Outlook integrations, wizard APIs
- Frontend (Live): onboarding wizard, admin UI, dashboards
- SDK: Python/TypeScript SDK, parity tests, examples
- DevOps/SRE: docker-compose, k8s, env wiring, observability bundle
- QA: e2e, smoke, connector test matrix, CI stability gates
- Docs: quickstarts, API reference, runbooks

## Stretch Goals (Weeks 13-16)

This set is only pursued if:
- 3+ design partners are above the "SCALE" threshold in `docs/status/PMF_SCORECARD.md`, and
- canonical stability gates remain green.

Suggested primary locations:
- Notion/Confluence: `aragora/connectors/enterprise/documents/` + `aragora/server/handlers/oauth_wizard.py`
- Jira: `aragora/connectors/enterprise/` + `aragora/server/handlers/*jira*`
- CLI scaffolding: `aragora/cli/init.py`, `aragora/cli/commands/`
- Helm: `deploy/k8s/` + `aragora-operator/`
