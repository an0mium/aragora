        "After careful analysis, I strongly endorse this approach. "
        "The benefits clearly outweigh the costs: reduced operational overhead, "
        "improved developer velocity, and better alignment with industry best practices. "
        "I recommend proceeding with a phased rollout starting with non-critical services.",
        "This is a sound strategy. The evidence points toward significant gains in "
        "maintainability and team productivity. Key advantages include clearer ownership "
        "boundaries, independent deployability, and the ability to scale components "
        "individually as demand requires.",
        "I see strong alignment between this proposal and our technical objectives. "
        "The approach is well-supported by industry data showing 40-60% reduction in "
        "deployment friction for organizations that have adopted similar patterns.",
    ],
    "critical": [
        "I have significant concerns about this approach. The migration cost is "
        "severely underestimated -- distributed systems introduce network partitioning, "
        "data consistency challenges, and operational complexity that monoliths avoid. "
        "Before committing, we need a detailed total-cost-of-ownership analysis.",
        "This proposal overlooks critical failure modes. The added latency from "
        "inter-service communication, the complexity of distributed tracing, and the "
        "talent cost of hiring engineers fluent in distributed architectures make "
        "this a high-risk endeavour with uncertain payoff.",
        "The claimed benefits are overstated. Most organizations that attempted this "
        "migration underestimated the operational burden by 3-5x. I recommend a "
        "modular monolith as the safer path that captures 80% of the benefits.",
    ],
    "balanced": [
        "There are valid arguments on both sides. The proposed approach offers "
        "scalability and team autonomy, but introduces operational complexity. "
        "I recommend a hybrid strategy: identify 2-3 bounded contexts that would "
        "benefit most, migrate those first, and measure results before expanding.",
        "The tradeoffs here are real. On one hand, the current architecture limits "
        "independent scaling and deployment. On the other, the migration carries "
        "execution risk and requires new tooling. A staged approach with clear "
        "success criteria at each gate would manage both sides effectively.",
        "Both approaches have merit. The key question isn't which is theoretically "
        "better, but which fits our team's current capabilities and growth trajectory. "
        "I suggest a 90-day proof-of-concept with measurable KPIs before committing.",
    ],
    "contrarian": [
        "I disagree with the prevailing direction. The popular choice is often wrong "
        "because it optimises for the visible problem while ignoring systemic risks. "
        "We should consider the opposite approach -- the simplest architecture that "
        "meets our actual (not hypothetical) requirements.",
        "Everyone seems to be converging too quickly. That's a red flag. Let me "
        "argue the unpopular position: our current approach, with targeted improvements, "
        "may outperform a wholesale migration. The grass isn't always greener.",
        "I'm intentionally taking the opposing view because premature consensus is "
        "dangerous. If we can't defend the mainstream proposal against serious "
        "objections, it's not ready for adoption. Here's my strongest counter-argument.",
