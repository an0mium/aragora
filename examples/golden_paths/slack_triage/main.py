"""
Golden Path 2: Slack Inbox Auto-Triage
=======================================

Demonstrates how Aragora's InboxDebateTrigger evaluates incoming messages,
detects critical priority, and spawns a mini-debate to produce a triage
recommendation with a decision receipt.

This simulates the flow without a live Slack connection:
  1. A mock Slack webhook payload arrives
  2. InboxDebateTrigger evaluates priority and rate limits
  3. A quick 2-round debate analyzes the message
  4. The result includes a recommendation and audit trail

No API keys or Slack workspace required.

Usage:
    python examples/golden_paths/slack_triage/main.py

Expected runtime: <5 seconds
