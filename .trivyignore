# Trivy ignore rules for Aragora
# See https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/docs/configuration/filtering/#by-trivyignore
#
# Format: One rule per line. Lines starting with # are comments.
# Rules can be CVE IDs, AVD IDs (AVD-DS-XXXX), or Trivy check IDs (DS0XX).
#
# OS-level CVEs in base images (python:3.11-slim, node:20-alpine):
# These are upstream vulnerabilities in the base OS packages that cannot be
# fixed by Aragora. They are tracked upstream and will be resolved when the
# base images publish patched releases. Findings are still uploaded to the
# GitHub Security tab via SARIF for visibility.
#
# To add a CVE to this list, verify:
#   1. The CVE is in an OS-level package (not an application dependency)
#   2. ignore-unfixed is already set (only fixable vulns are flagged)
#   3. The fix is not available in the current base image version
#
# Trivy image scans use exit-code 0 (non-blocking) and upload results to
# the GitHub Security tab for review. This file is referenced by the
# docker.yml workflow via the trivyignores parameter.
