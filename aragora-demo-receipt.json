    "Analyst": "I see strong alignment between this proposal and our technical objectives. The approach is well-supported by industry data showing 40-60% reduction in deployment friction for organizations that have adopted similar patterns.",
    "Critic": "The claimed benefits are overstated. Most organizations that attempted this migration underestimated the operational burden by 3-5x. I recommend a modular monolith as the safer path that captures 80% of the benefits.",
    "Synthesizer": "There are valid arguments on both sides. The proposed approach offers scalability and team autonomy, but introduces operational complexity. I recommend a hybrid strategy: identify 2-3 bounded contexts that would benefit most, migrate those first, and measure results before expanding.",
    "Devil's Advocate": "I disagree with the prevailing direction. The popular choice is often wrong because it optimises for the visible problem while ignoring systemic risks. We should consider the opposite approach -- the simplest architecture that meets our actual (not hypothetical) requirements."
