# External Pentest Execution Plan

Last updated: 2026-02-13

## Objective

Run a third-party penetration test and keep findings lifecycle visible in
`security/pentest/findings.json` so CI gate coverage reflects real engagement.

## Ownership

- Owner: Security
- Supporting teams: Platform, Runtime, SRE

## Timeline

- Vendor shortlist finalized: 2026-02-18
- Kickoff target: 2026-02-20
- Draft report target: 2026-03-20
- HIGH/CRITICAL remediation SLA: 14 days from report delivery

## Current Status

- Engagement status: `vendor_outreach_initiated`
- RFP batch sent: 2026-02-13
- Tracking files:
  - `security/pentest/findings.json`
  - `security/pentest/VENDOR_OUTREACH_LOG.md`

## Workflow

1. Update engagement metadata in `security/pentest/findings.json`.
2. Add findings as soon as draft report arrives (status `open` or `in_progress`).
3. Track remediation updates directly in each finding (`status`, `resolution`, `resolved_date`).
4. Keep `scripts/check_pentest_findings.py` green by resolving or accepted-risking
   HIGH/CRITICAL findings with rationale.

## Required Fields Per Finding

- `id`
- `severity`
- `title`
- `status`
- `description`
- `affected_component`
- `resolution`
- `resolved_date`
